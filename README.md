# Mac Overflow

Menu bar overflow manager for macOS. Never lose your menu bar icons again!

## The Problem

macOS menu bar has limited space. When you have many apps with menu bar icons, some get hidden and become inaccessible - especially on MacBooks with notches.

**Native macOS doesn't handle overflow** - icons just disappear.

## The Solution

Mac Overflow adds a simple overflow dropdown to your menu bar. Click one icon (≡) to see all your hidden menu bar items in a clean, organized list.

## Features

- 📊 **Overflow Management** - One icon shows all hidden items
- 🎯 **Click-through** - Click any icon in the dropdown to interact with it
- ⚡ **Lightweight** - Native Swift, minimal resource usage
- 🎨 **Clean Design** - Matches macOS system aesthetic
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** - No tracking, no internet access
- 🆓 **Free & Open Source** - MIT licensed

## Installation

### Homebrew (Coming Soon)
